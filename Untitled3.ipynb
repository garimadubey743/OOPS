For instance, by implementing these methods, you can dictate how your objects respond to mathematical operations, string representations, and more.\n","Key Categories of Dunder Methods\n","Initialization and Construction:\n","__init__(self,...): Initializes a new instance of a class. This method is invoked when an object is created, allowing you to set up initial attributes.\n","__new__(cls,...): Controls the creation of a new instance of a class.\n","__del__(self): Defines behavior when an object is about to be destroyed, used for cleanup operations.\n","String Representation:\n","__str__(self): Provides a user-friendly string representation of an object, useful for print() statements.\n","__repr__(self): Returns a more formal string representation of an object, often used for debugging and should convey enough information to recreate the object.\n","Arithmetic Operations:\n","Dunder methods like __add__(self, other) and __sub__(self, other) enable operator overloading, allowing custom classes to respond to arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction.\n","Comparison Methods:\n","Methods such as __eq__(self, other), __lt__(self, other), and others define how instances of a class are compared using operators like ==, <, and more.\n","Container and Iterable Behavior:\n","Implementing methods like __len__(self) and __getitem__(self, key) allows custom classes to act like built-in data structures, enabling functionalities like indexing and length calculation.\n","Callability:\n","__call__(self,...): Makes an instance of a class callable like a function.
